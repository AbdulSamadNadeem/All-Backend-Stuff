What Is A Event-Driven-Arcitecture??

.) In the Event-Driven-Arcitectur there are Three Main Players:

1)Event Emitter  ---> the Ones Who Emits Any Change Like Making A request To Server etc.
2)Event Listener  ---> it is the one who listen to change made by the emitter and send it to Event Handler.
3)Event Handler  ---> these are mainly callback functions which are trigger when the listener sends a request.

In JavaScript Programming there a popular pattern known as Observer Patter which is build by Event Emitter And Listener
the Emitters are known as Subject and the Listener are known as Object.It is designed to react rather than call.
